# **about**

My name is Viktor Vyskrebentsev. I’m Ukrainian. For over two decades, I have been passionate about software development, and for over a decade, I have been getting paid for building it.
I witnessed the early days of the modern internet as we know it, starting shortly after Amazon's launch and before Google’s PageRank.

This interest for the web has led me to work with various types of software products, but I often find myself involved in projects that David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) calls [Informational Technology Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M&t=327s), or what Martin Fowler refers to as [Enterprise Applications](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/EnterpriseApplication.html).
I personally prefer the term «Digital Habits Software» (which I plan to describe in a future post), but the name itself is not as important as what these software products have in common — people communicating over the internet guided by artificial rules.
That's what I find most fascinating.

Currently, I'm working on my personal product, [recario](https://github.com/viktorvsk/carbo) (soon to be [valent.network](https://valent.network)), which I will be dedicating a post to soon.

I’m always open to discussing how I can help aspiring founders (whether technical or not), startups, or established companies through consulting. The best way to reach me is usually through [email](mailto:me@viktorvsk.com).

I will be using this site to centralize my contacts and store all of my thoughts, even those that are not directly related to software and work, because the internet has interconnected all aspects of our lives, and there are no topics that are «out of politics» today :)
